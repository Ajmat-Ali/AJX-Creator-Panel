# Why “Content Ideas” FIRST? (Beginner logic)

A creator’s journey is:

1️⃣ First → Idea
2️⃣ Then → Script
3️⃣ Then → Schedule
4️⃣ Then → Performance
5️⃣ Dashboard Home shows summary of all

- So Idea is the root Everything else depends on it.

## STEP 1: Understand Content Idea like a REAL creator tool

## 🔹 What problem does “Content Idea” solve?

- A creator usually:
- Gets ideas randomly
- Forgets them
- Doesn’t know for which platform
- Can’t organize them

-**So your Content Idea page should answer:**

- “Where do I write, save, and manage my content ideas easily?”

That’s it.
If it does this well → project looks professional.

## STEP 2: What exactly should exist on Content Idea page

We break this page into 3 logical parts.

### ***Part A️ Add New Idea***

#### What inputs are REQUIRED (keep it simple):

1. Idea Title

   - Example:
     - Why consistency matters in coding

2. Platform

- Dropdown
- Options:
  - Instagram
  - YouTube
  - Twitter

3. Content Type

- Dropdown
- Options:
  - Reel / Short
  - Post
  - Long Video

4. Idea Description (optional but powerful)

- Small textarea
- Example:
  - **Explain with personal struggle story**

5. Save Button

- Saves to localStorage

## ***Part B️ Idea List***

After saving, user should see ideas.

Each idea card should show:

- Idea title
- Platform badge (Instagram / YouTube)
- Content type
- Short description
- Date (today’s date – frontend only)
- Delete button
- Edit later

## ***Part C️ Filter & Search***
